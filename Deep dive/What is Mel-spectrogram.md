- **What it is**: A **Mel-Spectrogram** is similar to a regular spectrogram, but it is transformed to represent the frequencies on the **Mel scale**, which is a perceptual scale of pitches that approximates how humans perceive frequencies.
    
- **How it's created**: The frequency bins of a regular spectrogram are mapped to the Mel scale, which emphasizes the lower frequencies more than the higher ones, reflecting how the human ear perceives sound.
    
- **Use**: Mel-spectrograms are widely used in speech processing, especially in tasks like **speech recognition** and **speaker identification**, because they align better with human auditory perception compared to linear frequency scales.
**Example**: In speech recognition, Mel-spectrograms capture the features of speech in a way that is more consistent with human hearing, making them effective for identifying spoken words.
