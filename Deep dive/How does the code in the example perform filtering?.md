This code
- captures real-time audio from a microphone (using pyaudio for audio capture)
- processes it
- and then displays the audio waveform (using matplotlib for visualization)
- and also displays its frequency spectrum (using matplotlib for visualization)


[[How does the code analyze the frequency content of the audio?]]
