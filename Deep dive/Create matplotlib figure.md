- A figure with two subplots (`ax1` and `ax2`) is created:
    
    - **ax1**: Displays the **audio waveform** (time domain representation).
        
    - **ax2**: Displays the **frequency spectrum** (FFT or frequency domain representation).
        
- Both plots are initially populated with random data as placeholders before the real-time data is provided.
