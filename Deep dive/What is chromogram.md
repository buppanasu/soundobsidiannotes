- **What it is**: A **chromogram** is a representation of the 12 pitch classes (or chroma) that make up the harmonic content of an audio signal. It emphasizes the harmonic structure of the signal and is often used in music analysis.
    
- **How it's created**: Itâ€™s usually calculated by mapping the spectrogram to the chroma scale, where each of the 12 chroma bins corresponds to one of the 12 notes in the Western musical scale (C, C#, D, etc.).
    
- **Use**: Chromograms are particularly useful in music for tasks like chord recognition, key detection, and music genre classification, as they capture the harmonic content of music.

**Example**: A chromogram will show the presence of musical notes in a piece of music over time, helping identify which chords or notes are played.
