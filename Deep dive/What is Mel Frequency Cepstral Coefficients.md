- **What it is**: **MFCCs** are coefficients that represent the short-term power spectrum of a sound. They are derived from the Mel-spectrogram and are often used to represent the timbral texture of speech or music.
    
- **How it's created**: After converting the audio into a Mel-spectrogram, a **discrete cosine transform (DCT)** is applied to the log-magnitude Mel-spectrogram to obtain a set of coefficients. These coefficients describe the spectral properties of the sound in a way that is useful for tasks like speech recognition.
    
- **Use**: MFCCs are widely used in **speech processing** for speaker recognition, speech-to-text conversion, and other tasks. They capture the key features of the audio signal, such as vowel and consonant sounds in speech, that are critical for recognition tasks.
    

**Example**: In a speech recognition system, MFCCs help identify the phonemes and the characteristics of the voice, making them essential for translating spoken language into text.
