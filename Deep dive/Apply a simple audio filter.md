- **Question**: "Modify the code to apply a low-pass filter to the audio before performing the FFT."
    
- **Expected Modification**: You could use a library like `scipy.signal` to apply a low-pass filter before performing the FFT. Hereâ€™s a basic example of applying a low-pass filter using `scipy`:

```shell
from scipy.signal import butter, lfilter

def butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order=5):
    nyquist = 0.5 * fs
    normal_cutoff = cutoff / nyquist
    b, a = butter(order, normal_cutoff, btype='low', analog=False)
    return b, a

def lowpass_filter(data, cutoff, fs, order=5):
    b, a = butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order)
    return lfilter(b, a, data)

# Apply the low-pass filter before performing FFT
cutoff = 1000  # Example cutoff frequency
data_int_filtered = lowpass_filter(data_int, cutoff, RATE)
yf = fft(data_int_filtered)

```
