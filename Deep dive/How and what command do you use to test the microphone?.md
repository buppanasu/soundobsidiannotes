## 1. Use the following to first record:
```shell
	arecord --duration=10 test.wav
```

Use the command in a different way:
```shell
	arecord --duration=<yourduration> <thefilenameyouwanttosaveto>
```

## 2. Then use the following to play it
```shell
 aplay test.wav
```

Remember not do delete the test.wav file as it will be used for further feature extraction.
