- **What it is**: A **spectrogram** is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. It shows how the frequency content of an audio signal changes over time.
    
- **How it's created**: Itâ€™s typically generated by performing a **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**, which splits the signal into small overlapping segments, calculates the Fourier transform for each segment, and then assembles them into a 2D image with time on the x-axis, frequency on the y-axis, and amplitude (or power) represented by color or intensity.
    
- **Use**: Spectrograms are used to analyze the frequency content of an audio signal over time, which is especially useful for identifying patterns in music, speech, and environmental sounds.
    

**Example**: A speech signal will show varying intensity in different frequency bands as the person speaks.
