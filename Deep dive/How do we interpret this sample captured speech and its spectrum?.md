- The top plot shows a sample time series of the captured audio and the bottom plot shows the frequency components present in the time series. It is easier to intepret audio by its spectrum.
- Try speaking, making different sounds and observe how the spectrum changes.

CGPT:

The graph shown contains two plots:

1. **Top Plot: Audio Waveform**
    
    - **X-axis (horizontal)**: Time, labeled from 0 to around 15,000 samples, representing the sequence of data points over time in the captured audio.
        
    - **Y-axis (vertical)**: Amplitude, indicating the strength or magnitude of the signal at any given point in time.
        
    - **Overall appearance**: The waveform shows a highly fluctuating pattern typical of speech. These fluctuations reflect changes in the soundâ€™s intensity over time.
        
        - **Key Points**: You can notice sharp peaks and valleys, which correspond to rapid changes in the sound, indicating high-energy moments (like consonants) and smoother portions (like vowels) in speech.
            
2. **Bottom Plot: Spectrum**
    
    - **X-axis (horizontal)**: Frequency, ranging from 0 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The frequency axis represents the different frequency components present in the audio signal.
        
    - **Y-axis (vertical)**: Amplitude (or power), showing the intensity of each frequency component.
        
    - **Overall appearance**: The spectrum plot shows a sharp drop-off at higher frequencies, with most of the energy concentrated in the lower frequencies.
        
        - **Key Points**:
            
            - The peak at lower frequencies indicates that the majority of the energy in the speech is concentrated in those lower frequencies (below 500 Hz).
                
            - There is very little energy in the higher frequencies above 15,000 Hz, which is typical for human speech. This could suggest a low-pass filter effect, where higher frequencies beyond human hearing or speech are diminished.
                

### How to Interpret the Two Plots:

1. **Audio Waveform (Top Plot)**:
    
    - The waveform is a time-domain representation of the audio signal, showing how the amplitude of the signal changes over time.
        
    - Large peaks and valleys represent significant variations in sound intensity.
        
    - For speech, you'll often see patterns of smooth curves interspersed with sudden spikes, which correspond to natural pauses, syllables, and consonant sounds.
        
2. **Spectrum (Bottom Plot)**:
    
    - The spectrum shows the frequency content of the signal, helping you understand the different frequency components that make up the sound.
        
    - Peaks on the frequency axis indicate the presence of dominant frequencies at that point in the signal.
        
    - For example, in speech, the spectrum may show higher energy at frequencies below 5,000 Hz, which is typical for most vocal sounds. If there were a significant presence of higher frequencies, you would see stronger peaks above 10,000 Hz.
        

### Steps to Analyze Future Graphs:

- **Waveform Analysis**:
    
    - Look at the **peaks** and **valleys** in the waveform to identify where there are strong sounds or pauses.
        
    - The shape of the waveform will help you identify patterns in speech such as syllables, pauses, and consonants.
        
- **Spectrum Analysis**:
    
    - Examine the **frequency axis** to see how the signal is distributed across different frequencies.
        
    - Check where the peaks occur. A higher peak at a specific frequency indicates that frequency contributes significantly to the sound.
        
    - A **drop-off** in higher frequencies can indicate that the signal lacks high-pitched elements, which is typical for speech.
        

### Final Summary:

- The **audio waveform** gives you an idea of how the sound evolves over time.
    
- The **spectrum** provides a snapshot of the frequencies present in the sound and their respective intensities.
