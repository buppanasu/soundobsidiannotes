It is important to see the `say something` before you start speaking as in the initial few seconds the ambient noise is being captured
- A sample display screen will look like as in below:Â

- It is very clear from the screenshot that an offline (inference done on the edge device) model like Sphinx is not as effective as a Google Speech Recognition API where inference is done on the cloud.
